# Stock Market Prediction Using Machine Learning

 The study critically examines the effectiveness of supervised machine learning techniques such as LSTM, ARIMA, and Linear Regressionâ€”for stock price prediction.

## ðŸ“š Overview
The paper reviews and compares three academic research studies using real-time and historical stock data from Tata and Reliance Industries. It highlights model architectures, performance metrics, and data considerations across each approach.

## ðŸ§  Models Explored
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Auto-ARIMA
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Hybrid CNN-LSTM models

## ðŸ“Š Key Topics
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Time series modeling challenges
- Metric comparison: RMSE, MAE, MAPE
- Practical implications for financial forecasting
